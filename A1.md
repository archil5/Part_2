Tab is simple app to split the bill among the friends. However, it’s not limited to just split the bill, it can split the amount according to what item is ordered by whom. Just click the photo of the bill, the app will read all the items with the price. Then user will select which item each person ordered. Tab have functionality in which if whole group has tab installed in their mobile they can join the bill and select their own items, Tab uses server to extract the data from the bill, so tab is real time application. Taxes and tips are also divided equally. It has also integrated bill settling system so that user can settle their bill by recording cash or their integrated Venmo system.

There are many applications available on Playstore which splits the bill, but none of them gives user access to select their ordered food and pay only for it, so here Tab comes with unique feature in which user can select their food from the whole bill and can only pay for it. And Tab also have option for selecting tax and tips percentage, so that user can split tax and tips equally.

People will like to go with this app because its handy and easy to use, as manually splitting the bill is hectic task. And even if someone has paid bill and split bill equally then also no equal splitting will be there as everyone have ordered different items, so they must pay for what they ordered. At that time Tab will be most useful.

In the app camera sensor is used to take the picture of receipt and then it is uploaded to the server for extracting the data from the receipt. So image to text technology is used.

The app comes under productivity application as it helps to organize the bill efficiently.

The strength of the app is simple functionality for selecting item splitting it and then for tips and taxes, it gives percentages function so that user can easily select the amount. However, it uses camera so camera quality must be good enough to recognize the receipt text, then internet is needed as app is uploading image to server for extracting the text.

Only one suggestion, try to make it totally offline so that no internet is needed, and image extraction can be done offline.

For different bill, it shows different screens, so everyone can know their own bill. While selecting the tax and tips it goes to separate screen so that user does not get confuse between bill tax and tips. So here in the minimal and simple design Tab provides decent functionality.
